VW e-Up
========

Vehicle Type: **VWUP**

This vehicle type supports the VW e-UP (2013-, 2020-), Skoda Citigo E IV and the Seat MII electric (2020-).
Connection can be made via the Comfort CAN bus, e.g. below the passenger seat (instead of the VW OCU there) and/or the OBD2 port to the top left of the driving pedals.

The code is shamelessly copied from the individual projects for the Comfort CAN by Chris van der Meijden and for the OBD2 port by Soko. Additional metrics and displays were added mainly for OBD2.

For details on the two connection types, please see the corresponding projects:

Supported Standard Metrics
--------------------------

The second column specifies the bus from which the metrics are obtained. Metrics via OBD are only updated when the vehicle is on (ignition started) or some in charging mode.
Metrics via T26 (Comfort CAN) can be updated on demand by waking the Comfort CAN from the OVMS module. During charging, the Comfort CAN automatically wakes every 5% of SoC.
