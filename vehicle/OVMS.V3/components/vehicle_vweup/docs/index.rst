Vehicle Type: **VWUP**

This vehicle type supports the VW e-UP, Skoda Citigo E IV and the Seat MII electric.

-----------------
Development notes
-----------------

The code is highly experimental. Some MsgIDs used are not confirmed yet.

When our pull request to the OVMS master repository is commited, these notes will be deleted.

To compile this code you will need to check out this repository, check out the components 
mongoose, libzip and zlib from the OVMS master repostory and copy the file

sdkconfig.default.hw31.vweup

from the OVMS.V3/support folder to the OVMS.V3 folder and rename it to

sdkconfig

----------------------------------------
Pinout OCU T26A - OVMS DB9 adapter cable
----------------------------------------

Because of the compilicated VAG OBD-gateway communication protocol
we directly tap into the comfort can bus over the OCU cable.

The OCU connector is located under the passenger seat.

Advantage is a faster and easier development.

Disadvantage is that we won't have all vehicle information available
and we won't be able to access all control units.

List of vehicle log files
-------------------------
the .asc files in this directory contain logs of all messages on the Comfort CAN while periodically issuing requests for certain known parameters at the OBD2-port.

**KCAN+obd_charge90-100_part?.asc: charging from about 90% to 100%**

due to github filesize limits, the file was split into parts using dd. It is advised to combine the files although they may also be used individually (with probably one corrupted message at the divisions).

car was fully asleep (no messages on KCAN), remote heating turned on via app, then turned off again until car was fully asleep, then repeated the process
