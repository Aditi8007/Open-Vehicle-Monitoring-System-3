VW e-Up 
=======

Because of the compilicated VAG OBD-gateway communication protocol
we directly tap into the comfort can bus over the OCU cable.

The OCU connector is located under the passenger seat.

Advantage is a faster and easier development.

Disadvantage is that we won't have all vehicle information available
and we won't be able to access all control units.
